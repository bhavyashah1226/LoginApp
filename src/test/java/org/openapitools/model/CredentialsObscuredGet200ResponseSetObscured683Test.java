================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The import 'import java.net.URI;' can potentially lead to Open Redirect attack if not properly validated. Attackers can manipulate the URI to redirect users to untrusted sites, leading to phishing attacks or stealing of user information.
Solution: Ensure any URI being used is validated against a whitelist of trusted URIs. Avoid using user input directly to construct URIs.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the provided code, exceptions are not handled. If an exception occurs, it might reveal system-specific details or sensitive application information to the user, which could be exploited by an attacker.
Solution: Implement exception handling mechanisms. Do not reveal sensitive system or application information in error messages. Log detailed error information in the server log files for debugging purposes.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The 'setObscured' method provided is declared as 'public', which means it can be accessed from anywhere. This can lead to potential misuse of the method, if it is not intended to be public.
Solution: Review the access modifiers for your methods and variables. If a method or variable does not need to be accessed outside of its class, declare it as 'private' or 'protected'.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'setObscured' method suggests that some form of data is being obscured. If not properly handled, this can lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is properly encrypted before storing or sending it. Use secure methods to obscure data, and limit access to this data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Null Input Value

Details:
  TestName: testSetObscuredWithNullInput
  Description: This test will validate the scenario when null is provided as the input to the setObscured() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed as we provide null as input.
  Act: Invoke setObscured() method with null.
  Assert: Check whether the obscured property is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the obscured property is null after the method call. If the method handles null inputs correctly, the obscured property should be null. This scenario is important to verify the robustness of the method against null inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with True Input Value

Details:
  TestName: testSetObscuredWithTrueInput
  Description: This test will validate the scenario when true is provided as the input to the setObscured() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed as we directly provide the boolean value true as input.
  Act: Invoke setObscured() method with true.
  Assert: Check whether the obscured property is set to true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the obscured property is true after the method call. This scenario is important to verify the method's functionality when true is provided as input.

Scenario 3: Test with False Input Value

Details:
  TestName: testSetObscuredWithFalseInput
  Description: This test will validate the scenario when false is provided as the input to the setObscured() method.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is needed as we directly provide the boolean value false as input.
  Act: Invoke setObscured() method with false.
  Assert: Check whether the obscured property is set to false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the obscured property is false after the method call. This scenario is important to verify the method's functionality when false is provided as input.
