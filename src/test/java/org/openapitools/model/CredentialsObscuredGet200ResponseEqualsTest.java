================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: Given that the 'equals' method uses object references, it can lead to unauthorized access if the 'o' object can be manipulated by an attacker. This is because the method checks if an object is equal without verifying the identity of the object itself.
Solution: Implement proper access control measures to prevent unauthorized access. This includes checking an user's authentication and authorization before granting them access to a specific object.

Vulnerability: Inherited Permissions (CWE-1028)
Issue: The 'equals' method lacks an explicit definition for permissions. Consequently, it inherits permissions from its parent class, which could grant overly broad access.
Solution: Include the 'equals' method within the scope of a security manager that limits permissions to just those necessary for its operation.

Vulnerability: Weak Referential Integrity (CWE-209)
Issue: The 'equals' method relies on weak referential integrity, which can lead to issues such as object spoofing, null pointer exceptions, or unintended side effects if object references are tampered with, leading to potential information leakage or integrity violations.
Solution: Perform null checks before accessing the object's properties. For better data integrity, consider implementing additional integrity checks, or use stronger object identity and lifecycle management practices.

Vulnerability: Unchecked Return Value (CWE-252)
Issue: The 'equals' method does not check for the exact type of 'o', using 'getClass()' method. If 'o' is an instance of a subclass of the current class, it will return false, which could lead to code that works differently than expected.
Solution: Use the 'instanceof' operator to check if 'o' is of the same type or a subtype of the current object. Also, handle possible types and subtypes explicitly to ensure correct behavior.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if an object is identical to itself

Details:  
  TestName: testIdentityCheckInEquals.
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the equals() method returns true when the object reference is identical to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a 'CredentialsObscuredGet200Response' object.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method by passing the same object reference as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert if the equals() has returned true.
Validation: 
  The assertion should verify if 'equals()' returns true when the object is compared to itself. It ensures that equals() abides by the reflexivity property prescribed for it, in accordance with Java's contract for the equals() method.

Scenario 2: Test to check if equals() method returns false when passed parameter is Null 

Details:  
  TestName: testNullOrOtherClassEqualsCheck.
  Description: This test ensures that the equals() method returns false when the parameter is either Null or not the same class as 'CredentialsObscuredGet200Response'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a 'CredentialsObscuredGet200Response' object and a Null object or an instance of other class.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method by passing the Null or other class instance.
  Assert: Check if the equals() has returned false.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms if 'equals()' returns false when passed a Null object or an object of another class. This adheres to the principle that an object must never be equal to a null or an object of a different class.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure comparable objects of the same class return true

Details:  
  TestName: testClassEqualityCheck.
  Description: This test is intended to check if objects of the 'CredentialsObscuredGet200Response' class are considered equal when their 'obscured' attributes match.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two 'CredentialsObscuredGet200Response' objects with identical 'obscured' parameters.
  Act: Invoke the equals() method from one object and pass the other as the parameter.
  Assert: Verify if equals() returns true.
Validation: 
  The test confirms if 'equals()' returns true when two distinct objects of the 'CredentialsObscuredGet200Response' class have identical 'obscured' attributes. It validates that the 'equals()' method correctly identifies equal objects based on the matching attribute.
