================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials
Issue: The getPassword() method returns a password directly. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information if the method is called inappropriately or the returned value is logged or mishandled.
Solution: Avoid storing passwords in plain text and returning them directly. Instead, store hashed versions of passwords and compare the hashed version of the input password with the stored hash. Use strong cryptographic hash functions such as bcrypt.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If an exception occurs while executing the getPassword() method, the default exception handling may reveal sensitive details about the system, potentially aiding an attacker.
Solution: Implement custom exception handling that does not reveal unnecessary information. Log the detailed error messages for debugging, but do not expose them to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: If the getPassword() method is used in a context where its return value is transmitted over a network, it may be sent in cleartext, which can be intercepted and read by an attacker.
Solution: Always use secure, encrypted connections (like HTTPS/TLS) when transmitting sensitive information like passwords over a network. Consider using secure methods or APIs that abstract away these details.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Regular Password Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testRegularPasswordRetrieval
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal functionality of the getPassword method, ensuring that it returns the correct password string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test instance with a known password.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword method on the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned password against the known password.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPassword method correctly returns the password set in the test instance. The expected result is the same password that was set in the test instance. This is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getPassword method.

Scenario 2: Null Password Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testNullPasswordRetrieval
  Description: This test is meant to check the getPassword method's behavior when the password is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test instance without setting a password (so it remains null).
  Act: Invoke the getPassword method on the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned password is null.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPassword method correctly handles a null password. The expected result is null, since no password was set in the test instance. This is significant as it tests the method's error handling and ensures that it does not throw an unexpected exception when the password is null.

Scenario 3: Empty Password Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyPasswordRetrieval
  Description: This test is meant to check the getPassword method's behavior when the password is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a test instance with an empty string as the password.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword method on the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned password is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPassword method correctly handles an empty password. The expected result is an empty string, as that was the password set in the test instance. This is significant as it tests the method's behavior with edge case input.
