ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_ceffa8036e

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure in logs (CWE-532)
Issue: The method toString() prints out sensitive user information, such as the username and password, which could be exploited if logs are not properly protected.
Solution: Refrain from logging sensitive information. If it is necessary, ensure your logging configuration is secured and logs are regularly monitored and cleaned.

Vulnerability: Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798)
Issue: This code contains placeholders that suggest potential hard-coding of username and password, this can lead to unauthorized access if discovered.
Solution: Ensure credentials or important data are not hardcoded in your source code. Use environment variables or secure properties files to store such data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Basic functionality test
Details:  
  TestName: testToStringBasicFunctionality
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString() method can correctly format a String representation of a LoginPostRequest object. It verifies the basic functionality and format of the output string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a LoginPostRequest with unique username and password.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the LoginPostRequest and obtain the resulting string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the output string matches the expected format and contains correct information.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that toString() respects the string format and correctly includes the username and password. This is essential to make sure that the data gets represented correctly in string format when needed.

Scenario 2: Null handling test
Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNullFields
  Description: This test checks how the toString() method handles the scenario when username and password are null. It tests the robustness of the function against possible null values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a LoginPostRequest where username and password are null.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the LoginPostRequest.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the real output against the expected output where the username and password are null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the function handles null values correctly and ensures the application's robustness.

Scenario 3: Empty string handling test
Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithEmptyFields
  Description: This test verifies how the toString() method handles the scenario when username and password are empty strings. This will test the flexibility of the function with different input types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a LoginPostRequest where username and password are empty strings.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method on the LoginPostRequest.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual output against the expected output where the username and password are empty strings.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies the function's complex data handling capability as this test represents an edge case where all string field values in the object are empty.
