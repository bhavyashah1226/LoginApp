================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Dependencies (CWE-827)
Issue: The use of outdated or insecure third-party libraries or dependencies can open up security holes. For example, Jackson Databind has had multiple vulnerabilities in the past.
Solution: Always use the most updated and secure versions of your dependencies. Keep an eye on newly released security patches or updates for the libraries you are using. You can use tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check to identify the use of known vulnerable components.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: Java code sometimes exposes internal objects, files, database records, or keys to users. If a user can guess or brute-force these references, they can bypass authorization and access resources directly.
Solution: Avoid direct object references when possible. If not possible, ensure proper controls are in place to verify the user is authorized to access the specific reference.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
Issue: With Java's extensive web server capabilities, monitoring for cross-site scripting is crucial. XSS occurs when untrusted data is sent to a userâ€™s browser without validation. Attackers can then run malicious scripts on a victim's browser.
Solution: Validate and sanitize input data to prevent the browser from treating it as code. Use built-in Java functions or libraries that can correctly escape special characters. Implement HTTPOnly cookies.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Valid Obscured Flag Value

Details:  
  TestName: testValidObscuredFlagParameter
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when a valid non null boolean value is passed as an argument to the obscured method. The target scenario is to ensure the method correctly assigns the value to the 'obscured' attribute and returns the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No required data or mocks setup necessary. 
  Act: Invoke the obscured method with a valid non null boolean value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of the 'obscured' attribute against the value passed.
Validation: 
  This assertion is checking that the method assigns the value to the 'obscured' attribute correctly and the value matches the parameter value passed in the method. This is significant in ensuring the data integrity of the 'obscured' attribute.

Scenario 2: Test Null Obscured Flag Value

Details:  
  TestName: testNullObscuredFlagParameter
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when a null value is passed as an attribute to  obscured method. The target scenario is to ensure the method correctly assigns the null value to the 'obscured' attribute and returns the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No required data or mocks setup necessary. 
  Act: Invoke the obscured method with a null value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of the 'obscured' attribute against null.
Validation: 
  This assertion is checking that the method assigns the null value to the 'obscured' attribute correctly. This is important as not all boolean attributes might always have a value and should be able to handle null values.
