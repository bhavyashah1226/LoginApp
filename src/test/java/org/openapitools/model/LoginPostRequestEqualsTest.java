================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The equals() method makes a direct comparison of private user data (username, password). This can potentially allow unauthorized users to access and manipulate an object in a manner that violates intended access restrictions.
Solution: To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using user-supplied input directly and employ access controls checks like using indirect references to objects.

Vulnerability: Insufficiently Protected Credentials or CWE-522
Issue: The code seems to handle credentials (username/password) in plain text format. Storing or handling credentials in plain text can pose a security risk if the data is compromised.
Solution: Store password data using strong cryptographic hash functions and also use salt. Use secure methods for handling and storing user credentials.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Error Message or CWE-209
Issue: If the comparison in the equals() method fails and it triggers an exception, the error message may give away crucial information about the user or the backend system.
Solution: Handle exceptions correctly and ensure that error messages don't expose any sensitive information.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing Equals Method with Same Object Instances
Details:
  TestName: equalsMethodWithSameInstances
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method is correctly identifying that two references pointing to the same object instance are indeed equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single instance of LoginPostRequest and assign it to two different reference variables.
  Act: Call the equals method on one reference and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true,
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same object instance are equal. It validates that equals() works as expected by contract with 'reflexivity' property.

Scenario 2: Testing Equals Method with Two Different Object Instances Having Same Values
Details:
  TestName: equalsMethodWithDifferentInstancesSameValues
  Description: This test will check if the equals method correctly identifies that two different object instances of LoginPostRequest with the same username and password values are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of LoginPostRequest with the same username and password values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the equals method can correctly identify that two distinct object instances with the same data values are equal. This test is significant as it validates 'symmetry' property of equals method.

Scenario 3: Testing Equals Method with Different Class Type
Details:
  TestName: equalsMethodWithDifferentClassType
  Description: This test is meant to ascertain if the equals method correctly identifies that an object of a different class type is not equal to a LoginPostRequest instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the LoginPostRequest instance and pass the different class instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that an object of a different class type is not equal to a LoginPostRequest instance. It's crucial for the consistency of equals method.

Scenario 4: Testing Equals Method for Null Object
Details:
  TestName: equalsMethodWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that a null object is not equal to a LoginPostRequest instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required.
  Act: Call the equals method on the LoginPostRequest instance and pass null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that a null object is not equal to a LoginPostRequest instance. It validates the null safety of equals method.

Scenario 5: Testing Equals Method with Two Different Object Instances Having Different Values
Details:
  TestName: equalsMethodWithDifferentInstancesDifferentValues
  Description: This test will check if the equals method identifies that two different object instances of LoginPostRequest with different username and password are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of LoginPostRequest with different username and password values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance and pass the other as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the equals method can correctly identify that two distinct object instances with different data values are not equal. This validates that the equals method works accurately for different instances.
