================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
Issue: The password appears to be set in plain text. This can leave the application vulnerable to various forms of attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks and data breaches.
Solution: Never store passwords in plain text. Use a cryptographic hash functions to save credentials. For instance, developers can use Java's MessageDigest class, together with an algorithm such as SHA-256, to perform password hashing before storing the password.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If a password is sent through GET request, it can be logged in various locations such as HTTP logs, browser history, and network equipments leading to sensitive information exposure.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET request. Use HTTP POST for sending sensitive data.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Valid password successfully sets the password
  Details:
    TestName: handleValidPassword.
    Description: The test is designed to check if a valid password is successfully set by the method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new LoginPostRequest instance and define a valid password string.
    Act: Invoke the password() method of the created instance with the valid password as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the returned object from the password() method should be same as the instance on which the method was invoked.
  Validation:
    If the password() method can successfully set the password, it should return the same instance on which it was invoked. This confirms that the password has been set successfully without any exceptions or errors.

Scenario 2: Handling of null password argument
  Details:
    TestName: handleNullPasswordArgument.
    Description: This test is intended to check the behavior of the password() method when null is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new LoginPostRequest instance.
    Act: Invoke the password() method of the created instance with null as the argument.
    Assert: Assert that the returned object from the password() method should be same as the instance on which the method was invoked.
  Validation:
    The purpose of this assertion is to verify that the password() method can handle null arguments and it does not throw an exception when null is passed. Instead, it continues execution and returns the same instance.

Scenario 3: Empty string as a password
  Details:
    TestName: handleEmptyStringPassword.
    Description: The test is focused on the functionality of the password() method when an empty string is passed as a password.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new LoginPostRequest instance.
    Act: Invoke the password() method of the instance with an empty string as the argument.
    Assert: Assert that returned object from the password() method should be same as the instance on which the method was invoked.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to validate that the password() method handles an empty string as a password input without throwing any exceptions and returns the same instance on which it was invoked.
