================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Library Usage (CWE-1104)
Issue: Using libraries that are outdated or have known security vulnerabilities can expose your application to potential attacks.
Solution: Always update third-party libraries to the latest secure versions. Continuously monitor for any updates or patches available for the libraries. Consider using tools such as OWASP's Dependency Check to help identify any known vulnerable dependencies.

Vulnerability: Failure to Protect Stored Data (CWE-922)
Issue: If sensitive data such as user credentials are stored without proper encryption, it can lead to data breaches.
Solution: Always hash and encrypt sensitive data. Use strong encryption and hashing methods. Never store passwords or other sensitive data in plaintext.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input (CWE-20)
Issue: If user inputs are not properly sanitized, it can result in issues like SQL injection, script injection, etc.
Solution: Always sanitize user inputs. Never trust user input blindly. Consider using prepared statements for database interactions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check Empty String
Details: 
  TestName: checkGetTextWhenEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getText() method is properly retrieving an empty string. The target scenario is when the text parameter is an empty string. 
Execution: 
  Arrange: Set the 'text' variable to an empty string.  
  Act: Invoke the getText() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result against an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getText() method accurately retrieves an empty string when 'text' is set to an empty string. The significance of this test is to ensure that the application correctly handles scenarios with empty inputs.

Scenario 2: Check Null
Details: 
  TestName: checkGetTextWhenNull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getText() method is properly retrieving a null value. The target scenario is when the text parameter is null.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Set the 'text' variable to null.  
  Act: Invoke the getText() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result against null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getText() method accurately retrieves a null value when 'text' is set to null. The significance of this test is to ensure that the application correctly handles scenarios with null inputs.

Scenario 3: Check Non-Empty String
Details: 
  TestName: checkGetTextWhenNonEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getText() method is correctly retrieving non-empty strings. The target scenario is when the text parameter is a non-empty string. 
Execution: 
  Arrange: Set the 'text' variable to a non-empty string.  
  Act: Invoke the getText() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the result against the non-empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getText() method can accurately retrieve a non-empty string when 'text' is set to a non-empty string. This test is significant to verify the correct retrieval of strings within the application.
