================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Insufficient Input Validation
Issue: The toIndentedString() method used for String content creation does not validate the input data. This can lead to issues like injection attacks, script execution, or data exposure.
Solution: Implement validation for input data that verifies against known good (whitelist), or unknown bad (blacklist) input. Sanitize data input by replacing, encoding or removing malicious input.

Vulnerability: CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data
Issue: The toString() method outputs sensitive internal details of the object. This can disclose internal workings or sensitive data to unauthorized recipients, leading to information leakage or system exploitation.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive data through the toString() methods. If necessary, mask or encrypt sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The StringBuilder can cause memory resource exhaustion if it is fed with large or complex data, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Apply a limit to the size of the input data that can be appended to the StringBuilder object. Or consider using alternative methods, such as Buffer, that offer better control over memory consumption.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing toString for a non-null status.

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNonNullStatus.
  Description: This test scenario is meant to verify if the toString method can accurately convert the status of a LoginButtonStatusGet200Response instance to an indented string when the status is a non-null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a LoginButtonStatusGet200Response instance with a non-null status.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string has the expected format and includes the indented form of the status as a string.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the toString method can correctly handle non-null status values. This is essential for any use-cases that require the status of a LoginButtonStatusGet200Response instance to be represented as a formatted string, such as logging or error reporting.

Scenario 2: Testing toString for a null status.

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNullStatus.
  Description: This test scenario is meant to verify if the toString method can handle a null status, which can occur if the status of a LoginButtonStatusGet200Response instance has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a LoginButtonStatusGet200Response instance with a null status.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string has the expected format and indicates that the status is null.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the toString method can handle a null status. This is crucial as it ensures the method is robust against missing or uninitialized data.

Scenario 3: Testing toString with different status types.

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithDifferentStatusTypes.
  Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the toString method can handle and accurately represent different types of status values, given that the status field is not strongly typed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple LoginButtonStatusGet200Response instances with statuses of various types.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on each instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned strings accurately represent their respective status types.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the toString method is flexible enough to handle statuses of various types. This is crucial as it ensures the method's usability across a wide range of scenarios, given the lack of strong typing for the status field.
