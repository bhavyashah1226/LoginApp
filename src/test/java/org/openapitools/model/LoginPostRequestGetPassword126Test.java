================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method getPassword() is public and returns a password, which can lead to information exposure if the returned password is not handled properly.
Solution: Ensure that the password is not logged, and is not returned in any API responses. Consider not storing the password in memory, or cleaning it from memory as soon as possible.

Vulnerability: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
Issue: It's unclear from the provided code if the password is stored in plain text or encrypted. Storing passwords in plain text is a major security vulnerability.
Solution: Passwords should be hashed and salted using a strong algorithm like BCrypt or Argon2. Do not attempt to implement your own cryptographic routines.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: Exposing sensitive data member like password through a public method could lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Avoid providing public methods that expose access to private information. If it's necessary, ensure to implement proper access controls and use secure methods to transmit sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Regular Password Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testRegularPasswordRetrieval
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal functionality of the getPassword method, ensuring that it returns the correct password string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a User object with a known password.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned password against the known password.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPassword method correctly returns the password set for a User object. The expected result is the same password that was set for the User object. This is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the getPassword method.

Scenario 2: Null Password Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testNullPasswordRetrieval
  Description: This test is meant to check the getPassword method's behavior when the password is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a User object without setting a password.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns null.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPassword method correctly handles null passwords. The expected result is null, as the User object was created without a password. This is important in ensuring that the method can handle edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Empty String Password Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStringPasswordRetrieval
  Description: This test is meant to check the getPassword method's behavior when the password is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a User object with an empty string as the password.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getPassword method can correctly handle passwords that are empty strings. The expected result is an empty string, as this was the password set for the User object. This is important in ensuring that the method can handle all types of valid password inputs, including edge cases such as an empty string.
